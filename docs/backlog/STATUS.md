## Decisions log
- 2026-10-03: License changed to AGPL-3.0-or-later. Sync target is the user's existing self-hosted Joplin Server (tests use a throwaway server). E2EE is enabled on the user's account. Gate: pause for user approval after Phase A.

- 2026-10-03: Added the `ci-cd-specialist` agent at the user's request. It owns public delivery (Docker Hub, GHCR, npm, GitHub Releases, MCP Registry, …) through GitHub Actions, and configures accounts through Playwright with the user entering credentials themselves.

## Open items for the user
- None yet. The architect and the ci-cd-specialist will add them after Phase A.
